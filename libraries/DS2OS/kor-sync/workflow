smaller network initializes handshake
-in case of equally large networks, leader with the lexicographically lower name initializes the handshake
only the leader of a group is allowed to do the handshake
all KAs of the other group must be known before handshaking (unconnected)
1)  initiator sends VslHandshakeData containing all connected KAs to the other leader and waits for a response
1.1)afterwards he continues with the retrieved VslHandshakeData response 3)
2)  other leader receives the handshakedata
2.1)other leader creates a new groupkey
2.2)other leader sends back his VslHandshakeData with his connectedKAs and the new key
2.3) afterwards he continues with 3)
3)  handshakeupdate:
3.1) both leaders store the new key after retrieving a copy of their old ones hash
3.2) new key is distributed to all connected KAs
3.3) new KAs are moved to connected

4)  update process (not necessarilly part of the handshake)
4.1)leaders collect full updates from all new KAs
4.2)send updates to all KAs of the old network) (with the old key, why?)
